Upload a photo of yourself that is appropriate to put onto a college website. We are planning on making a page on the college website that will provide information on the STEPUP program, as well as showcasing the students who are taking part in it this year. 

Make sure that your photo is a .jpeg file, and that your face is clearly shown.
